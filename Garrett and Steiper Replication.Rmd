At last! At long last! Here is my final R project!! After everthing kind of fell apart with my intended project, I am very happy to be replicating a 2014 paper by Eva Garrett and Michael Steiper titled <i>Strong links between genomic and anatomical diversity in both mammalian olfactory chemosensory systems</i>. This paper tested the relationships between the sizes of several skeletal structures and organs linked to the main olfactory and vomeronasal systems (MOS and VNS, respectively), as well as the number of both functional and total olfactory receptor (OR) or vomeronasal (V1R) genes (depending on the system). Additionally, all regressions were controlled for phylogenetic relatedness by using the phylogenetic least squares (PGLS) function from the caper package. The paper concluded that the variation in MOS anatomical phenotypes is correlated more with total number of olfactory genes and gene family size, while variation in the VNS anatomical phenotypes is correlated more with the number of functional genes. I am going to attemp to replicate these results. 

##Preliminaries

Before I could begin this project in my R space, I had to take a few initial steps that I feel I should mention. First of all, Eva gave me the data in a PDF format, so I had to painstakingly convert the it to an Excel spreadsheet, reformat the entire dataset, check my work against the original to make sure all the values were correct, and convert that again to a CSV file that I can upload here. Additionally, in this process I deleted a few columns of data that I deemed unnecessary for my final dataset, which consisted of columns denoting specimen numbers for the anatomical samples and reference numbers for data citing. Below are pictures of the unedited dataset in PDF format.
